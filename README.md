# Summary of Project

This portfolio page is an example of the skills we have learned up to this point in the bootcamp. Using everything from basic HTML/CSS elements and styles, to more advanced ones like media queries and grids. This portfolio can serve as a base that I can update throughout my time during these classes to better show of my skill.
